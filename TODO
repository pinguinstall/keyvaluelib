thing still missing or not well implemented.

missing features:
- table and kv entries with type void*, which just point to some data somewhere in the memory
-- a print function must be provided for such things by the user
-- a size_t entry must be introduced for the KV store to hold the size of the data
-- the kvcolumn_t could be extended by a "size_t *datsizes" variable which hold all the sizes for
   the data in a col

- user specific printout of the table and kv-store, now the format is fixed
- remove cols and rows from tables
- finish key and entry lists, or remove them
- for every access to the structures a linear search is performed, we could sort the keys and do
divide and conquer to speed up the search

- complete tests (make check)

not well implemented:
- well, dunno probably a lot ;-)
